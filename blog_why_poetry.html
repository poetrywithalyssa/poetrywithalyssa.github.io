		<h2 class="title">WHY POETRY?</h2>
			<p>Hello, interweb denizens. My name’s Alyssa and I’m keen on poetry. Although, I figured you gathered as much from the blog name. However, I suppose you may be questioning why. Why poetry? Why a blog is this day and age?</p>

			<p> To the latter of the two hypotheticals, I’ll concede that that’s a fair question. Blogs are a well-known and moderately dated internet phenomenon. This means of expression has been swiftly replaced by podcasts, vlogs (video blogs), and a litany of other media. It’s also not a particularly well-kept secret as to the ubiquity of blogs within the writing community. Well, writers and aspiring writers. Many use it as a starting point for larger pieces of work since it allows writers to get their names out into the world in addition to improving their discipline--a good blog has regular updates, of consistent quality, after all.</p>

			<p>I don’t inherently consider myself a writer so much as someone who happens to write. Nevertheless, I wanted to start this blog as a way to write more conscientiously about something I’m interested in. Thus, we’ve arrived at the question: Why poetry? </p>

			<p>Until seventh grade, I didn’t have particularly strong feelings about poetry.I considered it an artform and owned Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky books, but I never actively engaged with poetry. As a part of a speaker series at my school, spoken word artists, Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye, performed during an assembly. </p>

			<p>I was immediately astounded and enamored with what I had experienced from their reading. It was a type of poetics that I had never heard nor knew of before. Later in the week they had a longer evening show at my school which I, of course, went to. From there, I fell down a rabbit hole of spoken word and slam poetry. There was also a brief stint where I was obsessed with English Romantic, William Blake, and I’m not entirely sure why that was the case. </p>

			<p>Regardless, I fell in love with poetry after their reading. Phil and Sarah were definitely formative figures in how I view and approach my poetics, and I will most likely write a blogpost in the near future discussing their work. Since then, I’ve used poetry to help me cope with grief, loss, and on the special occasion, express joy. Poetry is the splendor that I encase myself in when I’m lonely, but it is also the art I use to lift myself out. So, why do I choose poetry? Because it is a wonderfilled art teeming with creation and potentiality of new life and expression. </p>

			<p>Until next time, I leave you with a poem.</p>

			<p>Cheers, <br>
			Alyssa</p>

				I wish in the temple of your heart<br>
				you would let me be the garden<br>
				where you ponder your sorrows.<br>
				I imagine the barren ponds filling--<br>
				it has been pouring, but the storm<br>
				is done now and the saplings<br>
				begin to emerge through<br>
				the tear-soaked earth a we sit<br>
				together in the peace of your temple.
