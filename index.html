	<h1> Poetry With Alyssa </h1> 
	<h2> About </h2>
		<p> My name's <b> Alyssa </b> and I'm fairly keen on poetry. Although, I'd imagine that this is redundant given the name of this page. </p>
	<h3> I. Season of Waves: Old Town, Sweden </h3>
		<p> My way to you was long, and there were no lights for me to harvest in the cities <br> below but rather an unnverving amount of darkness like a void, and when I reached you, the air <br> around me felt much like the cool of the cabin, except you had an air about <br> you that was dry, cobblestone paths connecting your modern veins to ancient thoroughfares <br> where great ships left your harbors to explore the unknown weaving in and out of your <br> archipelago, returning; once new treasures found then returned to castles about the city--those <br> castles became history and now your children learn as students in these ancient walls once <br> harboring great wealth in gold and sustenance but now in knowledge that will spread beyond <br> your borders and return to renew your land to continue building, higher until everything <br> returns back to you.
