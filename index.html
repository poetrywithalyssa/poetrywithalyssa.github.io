	<h3> <font face="Garamond" color="f8f8ff"></font>WHY POETRY?</h3>
		<p> <font face="Garamond" color="f8f8ff"></font>Hello, interweb denizens. My name’s Alyssa and I’m keen on poetry. <br>Although, I figured you gathered as much from the blog name. However, I suppose you may be questioning why. <br> Why poetry? Why a blog is this day and age? </font> </p>

		<p> To the latter of the two hypotheticals, I’ll concede that that’s a fair question. Blogs are a well-known and <br> moderately dated internet phenomenon. This means of expression has been swiftly replaced by podcasts, vlogs (video blogs), <br> and a litany of other media. It’s also not a particularly well-kept secret as to the <br>ubiquity of blogs within the writing community. Well, writers and aspiring writers. Many use it as a starting <br>point for larger pieces of work since it allows writers to get their names out into the world in addition to <br>improving their discipline--a good blog has regular updates, of consistent quality, after all.</p>

		<p>I don’t inherently consider myself a writer so much as someone who happens to write.<br>Nevertheless, I wanted to start this blog as a way to write more conscientiously about something I’m interested in. Thus, we’ve arrived at the question: Why poetry? </p>

		<p>Until seventh grade, I didn’t have particularly strong feelings about poetry.<br>I considered it an artform and owned Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky books, but I never actively engaged with poetry.<br>As a part of a speaker series at my school, spoken word artists, Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye, performed during an assembly. </p>

		<p>I was immediately astounded and enamored with what I had experienced from their reading.<br>It was a type of poetics that I had never heard nor knew of before. Later in the week they had a longer<br>evening show at my school which I, of course, went to. From there, I fell down a rabbit hole of spoken word and slam poetry.<br> There was also a brief stint where I was obsessed with English Romantic, William Blake, and I’m not entirely sure why that was the case. </p>

		<p>Regardless, I fell in love with poetry after their reading. Phil and Sarah were definitely<br>formative figures in how I view and approach my poetics, and I will most likely write a blogpost<br>in the near future discussing their work. Since then, I’ve used poetry to help me cope with grief, loss, and on the special<br> occasion, express joy. Poetry is the splendor that I encase myself in when I’m lonely,<br>but it is also the art I use to lift myself out. So, why do I choose poetry? Because it is a wonderfilled art teeming with creation and potentiality of new life and expression. </p>

		<br>Until next time, I leave you with a poem from my chapbook. <br>

		Cheers, <br>
		Alyssa

		<p>your hands became the storytellers you could not be,<br>arbitrary gestures forming stories of omission<br>spelled out, etching prose into emptiness.<p>

		<p>before your move, we sit at the dining<br>room table, and I see you shake, raising a spoonful<br>of soup to your lips, careless.<p>

		<p>in the care home, you slowly raise your arm<br>to wipe your eye but stop an inch away<br>from your face, miming the motion.<p>
