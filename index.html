			<p> Hello, interweb denizens. My name’s Alyssa and I’m keen on poetry. Although, I figured you gathered as much from the blog name. However, I suppose you may be questioning why. Why poetry? Why a blog is this day and age?</p>

			<p> To the latter of the two hypotheticals, I’ll concede that that’s a fair question. Blogs are a well-known and moderately dated internet phenomenon. This means of expression has been swiftly replaced by podcasts, vlogs (video blogs), and a litany of other media. It’s also not a particularly well-kept secret as to the ubiquity of blogs within the writing community. Well, writers and aspiring writers. Many use it as a starting point for larger pieces of work since it allows writers to get their names out into the world in addition to improving their discipline--a good blog has regular updates, of consistent quality, after all.</p>

			<p>I don’t inherently consider myself a writer so much as someone who happens to write. Nevertheless, I wanted to start this blog as a way to write more conscientiously about something I’m interested in. Thus, we’ve arrived at the question: Why poetry? </p>
